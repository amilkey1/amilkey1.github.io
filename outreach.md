# Community outreach

Here are links to lessons I have designed for students in the local community. Lessons are designed to introduce children to concepts in phylogenetics and systematics.
Each link contains a zip file with worksheets printed out for students and/or powerpoint presentations given.
Each zip folder also contains a "README" document with instructions for carrying out the lesson.

# Departmental efforts


As part of the UConn EEB grad student outreach committee, I created an [outreach website](https://uconneeb.github.io/outreach) to bring together outreach materials developed by graduate students in the department.
