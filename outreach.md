Here are links to lessons I have designed for students in the local community. Lessons are designed to introduce children to concepts in phylogenetics and systematics.
Each link contains a zip file with worksheets printed out for students and/or powerpoint presentations given.
Each zip folder also contains a "README" document with instructions for carrying out the lesson.
