[LoRaD: Lowest Radial Distance Method of Marginal Likelihood Estimation R Package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lorad/index.html)\
This R package estimates marginal likelihood from a posterior sample as described in [Wang et al. (2023)]("PDFS/lorad.pdf"). The method does not require evaluation of any additional points and requires only the log of the unnormalized posterior density for each sampled parameter vector.
