								My previous research focused on convergent evolution in morphology associated with transitions to selective zooplanktivory in butterflyfishes in the lab of <a href=https://fishlab.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Dr. Peter Wainwright.</a>
								<br>
								Now, I focus on statistical phylogenetics. My most recent project has developed a better way of estimating marginal likelihood, which is used to compare competing Bayesian models.
